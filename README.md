Creating Bryntum Gantt .NET TypeScript and React Guides using:

- Amp and Claude Opus 4.5
- Context: 
  - working .NET Gantt backend and Gantt frontends (that were created using https://github.com/ritza-co/bryntum-backend-quickstart-guides and Cursor chat (Claude Opus 4.5)) - in `/code` folder
  - .NET TypeScript and React Calendar Guides - in `/related-guides` folder

Once the guides are created, do QA:

- Copy starter code from `/code` folder to `/QA` folder.
- Ask Claude to go through the created guides using the starter code in `/QA` folder to create the completed guide code.
- Once complete, check if the completed guide code in the `/QA` folder matches the code in the `/code` folder.
