Style edits specific to Matt - the writer.

## Style Rules

### Repetition

- Vary opening words of consecutive sentences - avoid starting multiple sentences with the same word. For example:

```
- Create a backend ...
- Create a frontend...
```
- Check for repeated phrases/sentences and rephrase duplicates.

### Tense

- Prefer present tense over future tense for conciseness.
- Search for "will" and "'ll" and convert to present tense where possible.

### Passive Voice

- Default to active voice verbs.
- Only use passive voice when:
  - The subject is missing or too complicated to explain briefly
  - Active voice would add another clause to an already long sentence
- **Code explanations specifically**: Always use present tense, active voice verbs after code blocks.

### Parallel Structure

- List items must have consistent grammatical structure (all full sentences or all fragments, not mixed).
- Headings at the same level should have the same grammatical structure (e.g., all imperative verbs or all gerunds).

### Specificity and Conciseness

- Avoid vague phrases like "can be useful" - be specific about the benefit.
- Remove filler words that don't communicate important information (e.g., "handle" when it adds nothing).
- Use "whether" instead of "if" when appropriate for conditionals.

## Consistency Rules

### Code Formatting

- Be consistent with backticks and quotation marks - don't mix styles for similar items.
- Terminal output should be formatted as code.

### Punctuation

- Sentences with the same structure should use the same punctuation pattern.
- Consider moving prepositional phrases to sentence beginnings to avoid comma issues.

### Naming

- Refer to data types (resources, events, etc.) consistently throughout.
- Use correct product name formatting (e.g., "Task Board" not "Taskboard").

### Links and Explanations

- Place links and explanations at the first mention of a concept, not later mentions.
