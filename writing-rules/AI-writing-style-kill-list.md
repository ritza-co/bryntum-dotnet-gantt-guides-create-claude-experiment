# AI Writing Style Kill List

1.  **Em-dashes:** Never use em-dashes (—) or hyphens (-) for emphasis or clause separation. Only use hyphens for bulleted lists in Markdown.
    *   **Don't:** It's not just a product - it's a lifestyle.
    *   **Do:** It's a lifestyle, not just a product.
    *   **Do:**
        - List item 1
        - List item 2

2.  **"It's not just X, it's Y" phrasing:** Avoid this marketing-speak pattern. Rephrase into a more direct and plain sentence.
    *   **Don't:** It's not just a tool, it's a complete development environment.
    *   **Do:** It's a complete development environment.

3.  **Unsupported Claims and Strawman Arguments:** Avoid making broad, general claims about how things are typically done, especially without evidence. Do not create a "bad way" to do something just to make your "good way" seem superior, as this can erode reader trust.
    *   **Don't:** "Most CRM systems treat customer interactions as isolated events. We'll show you a better way."
    *   **Do:** "By connecting customer interactions, we can build a more comprehensive view of the customer journey. Here's how to do it."
