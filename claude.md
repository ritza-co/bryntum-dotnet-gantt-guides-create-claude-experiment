# Instructions

I want you to create 2 Bryntum Gantt Guides:

1. How to use Bryntum Gantt with .NET and SQLite (Using TypeScript) in `/draft.md`
2. How to use a React Bryntum Gantt with .NET and SQLite in `/draft-react.md`

I created similar guides for the Bryntum Calendar. Use them as reference to create the Gantt guides.
I have created the working code and starter code already in the `/code` folder.

## Steps to follow

### vanilla typescript guide

- first read through and understand the working code and starter code :
  - `/code/dotnet-sqlite-gantt`
  - `/code/gantt-vanilla`
  - `/code/gantt-vanilla-starter`

- Create the guide in `/draft.md`. The text in the guide is for the Calendar guide, modify it based on the code and starter code. First ultrathink and come up with a plan. ONLY change `/draft.md`.
- Once you have created the guide QA the guide by using the following steps:

 Go through `/draft.md` to check that the guide produces working code. Modify the `/QA/dotnet-sqlite-gantt-starter` and `/QA/gantt-vanilla-starter` code, which I copied from the starter GitHub repositories. ONLY change the files in the QA folder. 

Check that the final code (I tested it already - it works) matches the code in:
- `/code/dotnet-sqlite-gantt-starter`
- `/code/gantt-vanilla-starter`

If it doesn't work, fix the guide and try again.

### React guide

- first read through and understand the working code and starter code :
  - `/code/dotnet-sqlite-gantt`
  - `/code/gantt-react`
  - `/code/gantt-react-starter`

- Create the guide in `/draft-react.md`. The text in the guide is for the Calendar guide, modify it based on the code and starter code. First ultrathink and come up with a plan. ONLY change `/draft-react.md`.
- Once you have created the guide QA the guide by using the following steps:

 Go through `/draft-react.md` to check that the guide produces working code. Modify the `/QA/dotnet-sqlite-gantt-starter` and `/QA/gantt-react-starter` code, which I copied from the starter GitHub repositories. ONLY change the files in the QA folder. 

Check that the final code (I tested it already - it works) matches the code in:
- `/code/dotnet-sqlite-gantt-starter`
- `/code/gantt-react-starter`

If it doesn't work, fix the guide and try again.

## CHANGELOG.md

After each LLM output, add a summary of changes to CHANGELOG.md. Add prompt used and a summary of the changes. Format to use:
